'providers' => [
    ...
    ScoutEngines\Elasticsearch\ElasticsearchProvider::class,
],
```

### Setting up Elasticsearch configuration
You must have a Elasticsearch server up and running with the index you want to use created

If you need help with this please refer to the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html)

After you've published the Laravel Scout package configuration:

```php
// config/scout.php
// Set your driver to elasticsearch
    'driver' => env('SCOUT_DRIVER', 'elasticsearch'),

...
    'elasticsearch' => [
        'index' => env('ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX', 'laravel'),
        'hosts' => [
            env('ELASTICSEARCH_HOST', 'http://localhost'),
        ],
    ],
...
```
